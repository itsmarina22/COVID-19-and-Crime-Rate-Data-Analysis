The COVID-19 pandemic has had multifaceted effects across various aspects of life, including social, physical, and mental health. Among its less apparent impacts are those on crime rates. Existing research indicates that the pandemic has led to significant shifts in crime rates compared to pre-pandemic levels, but the direction and magnitude of these changes vary by crime type. This study aims to investigate these dynamics, particularly focusing on trends in violent crime rates in correlation with COVID-19 data in California. This study particularly looks at data for the top 15 most populated counties in California, and the data is specifically between July 2020 to March 2022.


This is the Winter 2024 COGS108 Final Project at UC San Diego conducted and researched by Group 22 (Marina Hu, Allison Huang, Samuel Lee, Audrey Liang, and Lilian Xia). Huge thanks and shoutout to my amazing team for working with me and for making this project come to life!
